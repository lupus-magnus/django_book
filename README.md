This directory was made with the intention of practicing Python and the Django framework. For my guidance, I will be using the book "Python e Django - Desenvolvimento Web Moderno e Ágil", written by Francisco Marcelo de Barros Maciel.

<h2 align="center"> 📌 Goals and Challenges</h2>ls

The main goal, at first, is to practice my Python skills and good practices. I'll try to be using the best market standards as I code. If you notice something that can be improved, don't hesitate to share that with me, by opening issues or comments.

<h2 align="center"> 🤔  How to Use It </h2>

<p>First of all, it is important to understand that the book is divided in two parts, and so it's gonna be in our project. In the first section, Python itself will be discussed and several challenges presented. In that sense, I'm going to try and solve this, in order to practice my logic and problem solving in the language. All of that is going to be inside the folder "practice".</p>
<p>
Secondly, we will focus on the django section of the book. During this time, we will develop an application acording to the book suggestion, which is a virtual store.
